# Data

The only file that needs to be modified and provided is the `resume.yaml`
(or `resume.json`) file. You can take inspiration from the example
[`02_intermediate/resume_example.yaml`](02_intermediate/resume_example.yaml) (or
[`01_raw/resume_example.json`](01_raw/resume_example.json)).
This is a yaml file containing your CV information. The format is that provided
by [jsonresume](https://jsonresume.org/schema).
